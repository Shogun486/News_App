News App
==========

This project is an Android app (using Java) allowing users to browse
through the latest/current news from 128 different sources. These media outlets are mostly
in English, but there are also some in foreign languages. If you want to
narrow your search, there is a filtering mechanism: you can browse accordingly 
to the topics yous want (for instance, "sports"). Each news source is color-coded
based on their subject focus, making it easier for you to navigate the app. 

## Tools

This app is programmed entirely in Java. The
following libraries are utilized:
  * Volley (API calls)
  * Glide (for image displays)

## Running the App

Simply install Android Studio --> Build Clean Project --> Run on an emulator
(this app has been tested on multiple devices with multiple screen sizes,
so feel free to run the app on any device you choose)
